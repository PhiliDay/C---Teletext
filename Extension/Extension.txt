/*EXTENSION*/
To run:
download imageMagick

make run

Shows the RGB values of all the pixels within the image 'red.png'.

For my extension I attempted to create a program that converted an image to the
teletext screen.  I did not have time to finish this but I will outline what I
have done and what I intended to do.

What I have done:
I first downloaded the library imageMagick which would enable me to get the
relevant details I needed from jpeg files.  To convert a jpeg image and render
on the SDL screen I had to take numerous steps.  Firstly I had to read an
image in using the function 'MagickReadImage'. The image would have to be resized
to ensure that it fits the SDL screen.  I did this using the 'MagickGetImageWidth'
and 'MagickGetImageHeight'.  Creating a while loop enabled me to make sure that
if the image was more than 40 in width and more than 25 in length (the size of
my array in teletext) I would divide the image by two while the image was out
of bounds to ensure that it would fit the screen.

Next to find out the RGB values  I used 'MagickGetImagePixelColor'.  This enabled
me to get RGB values from an image and place them into an array. When getting
these the format received was in 'rgb(0,0,0);'.  This meant that I needed to
get each value for red, green and blue into seperate arrays and with only
digits being stored.

What I would have done:
To do this I would've created a struct with red, green and blue integers.  Using
if statements and 'isdigit', I would be able to ensure only the numbers are taken
into the array.  From here I would have created an average of the three RGB values
and using the sixel calculator I created in teletext.c, if the average was over
a certain value (e.g. 200) then the sixel would be 'LIT'.

I would have then created an input so the user can input two different colours
they want, so the 'LIT' sixels will have one colour and the other sixels will
have different colours.
